## Wins

	* All iterations finished!

## Challenges + Improvements

	* Lost overlay; it now displays to the side of all book covers
	* Future Iterations:
      * Error Handling
      * Saved data persists on reload
      * When a user single clicks a saved cover, create a modal to view it larger
      * Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want  
        them to appear
